# Good Benefits
The benefits for Good people.

## Summary of Good Benefits
Good employees are entitled to unlimited vacation and personal leave, and we work (for the most part) whenever and wherever we want. With that freedom does come great responsibility, however. All employees are expected to complete their work for any given project(s) on time. It is your responsibility to ensure you are budgeting enough time to complete projects. Had to take a few hours off for an appointment? Maybe make it up later that day or later that week if you think it’ll put you behind on something you’re working on. Let’s be responsible.

Where vacation or personal leave becomes excessive to the point of causing poor quality or delay in work, further leave may be denied and/or disciplinary action may occur.

### 1. Work whenever you want
All we ask is that you get your work done on time and attend required meetings.


### 2. Work wherever you want
You aren’t bound by an office. Work from anywhere that has a good Internet connection so we can still have GIF wars. :-)


### 3. Take time off
Life happens. Burnout happens. Take time off.


### COMMON HOLIDAYS (most people will be out on these days)
* New Year’s Day
* Memorial Day
* Independence Day
* Labor Day
* Thanksgiving and the day after
* Christmas (25th & 26th)
